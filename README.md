# Sajari React SDK

The Sajari React SDK is broken into 4 separate packages:

- `@sajari/react-components` - Core components that allow you to build a beautiful search interface with any back end.
- `@sajari/react-hooks` - Hooks that allow you to build a search interface using any component library.
- `@sajari/react-search-ui` - Easy to use search components to quickly build a beautiful search interface. If you've used previous versions of our SDK, you'll be most familiar with this package.
- `@sajari/server` - Helpers for server-side rendering your React application using Sajari search.
