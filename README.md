## Introduction

The Search.io React SDK is a library of React Hooks and Components to help build fast and powerful search interfaces.

React provides a simple and elegant way to structure user interfaces. Aside from providing generic UI components, the Search.io React SDK also provides a way to seamlessly integrate the Search.io Search platform into any web-based app through the use of easily composable Components.

There are three main packages allowing you to pick and choose the right solution for your application:

The Search.io React SDK is broken into 4 separate packages:
