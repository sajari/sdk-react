# Getting Started

The Search.io React SDK is a library of React Hooks & Components to help build fast and powerful search interfaces.

React provides a simple and elegant way to structure user interfaces. The Search.io React SDK provides a way to seamlessly integrate the Search.io platform into any web-based app through the use of easily composable Components.

There are three main packages allowing you to pick and choose the right solution for your application:

<Box
  display="flex"
  flexDirection={['flex-col', 'lg:flex-row']}
  space={['space-y-4', 'lg:space-x-4', 'lg:space-y-0']}
  margin="my-8"
>
  <PackageTile
    href="/components"
    title="Components"
    description="Core components that allow you to build a beautiful search interface with any back end."
    gradient={['from-red-400', 'to-red-500']}
  />
  <PackageTile
    href="/hooks"
    title="Hooks"
    description="React hooks that allow you to build a Search.io-powered search interface using any component library."
    gradient={['from-green-400', 'to-green-500']}
  />
  <PackageTile
    href="/search-ui"
    title="Search UI"
    description="Easy to use search components to quickly build a beautiful Search.io-powered search interface."
    gradient={['from-blue-400', 'to-blue-500']}
  />
</Box>
