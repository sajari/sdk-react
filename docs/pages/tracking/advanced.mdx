# Advanced tracking

Search.io's `EventTracking` provides flexible tracking which can be used to provide both useful analytics and to feed Search.io's machine learning algorithm data about the performance of search results.

## Example

This example includes three files of a shopping cart funnel where events are used to track search results (store products) as they move through the search -> add to cart -> purchase funnel. Additionally, localStorage is used to persist events for 30 days in case the initial search and final purchase occur over separate browser sessions.

On a search result screen, we can use the Search.io pre-built support rendering search results which includes storing events of clicked results into localStorage and sending them to Search.io as soon as possible.

```jsx
/**
 * example-store.com/product-search
 */
function ExampleProductSearch() {
  const pipeline = new Pipeline(
    {
      account: '1594153711901724220',
      collection: 'bestbuy',
    },
    'query',
    // Ensure field passed to EventTracking constructor is unique across products.
    new EventTracking('id'),
  );

  const ExampleSearchResults = React.memo(() => (
    <div className="flex flex-col space-y-6">
      <Input />
      <Results />
    </div>
  ));

  return (
    <SearchProvider
      search={{
        pipeline,
        fields: new FieldDictionary({
          title: 'name',
          subtitle: (data) => data.level4 || data.level3 || data.level2 || data.level1 || data.brand,
        }),
      }}
      searchOnLoad
    >
      <ExampleSearchResults />
    </SearchProvider>
  );
}
```

When a result is clicked we track a `click` event associated with query result from the previous screen. This lets the Search.io engine know that this was likely a good result for the search term.
Then, when a customer adds a product to their cart, we track an `add_to_cart` event which gives a stronger signal for this result. The customer has moved closer to the end of the funnel.

Unlike other examples which render Search.io search results, this is purely an example of how your own brand's storefront might be setup.

```jsx live=false
/**
 * example-store.com/product-details/{productId}
 */
import { useTracking } from '@sajari/react-hooks';

function ExampleProductDetails({ productId }) {
  const product = useAsync(fetchProductDetails(productId));
  const pipeline = new Pipeline(
    {
      account: '1594153711901724220',
      collection: 'bestbuy',
    },
    'query',
    // Ensure field passed to EventTracking constructor is unique across products.
    new EventTracking('id'),
  );
  const { tracking } = useTracking();

  const addToCart = () => {
    asyncAddToCart(product.id);
    // send a 'add_to_cart' event for this specific product.
    tracking.searchIOAnalytics.track('add_to_cart', product.id);
  };

  return (
    <ProductPageScaffolding>
      <ProductDetails product={product} />
      <AddToCartButton onClick={addToCart} />
    </ProductPageScaffolding>
  );
}
```

Once a customer reaches the end point of the funnel, the cart checkout confirmation screen, we submit a `purchase` event indicating a successful purchase.

Unlike other examples which render Search.io search results, this is purely an example of how your own brand's checkout might be setup.

```jsx live=false
/**
 * example-store.com/cart-checkout-confirmation/{cartId}
 */
import { useTracking } from '@sajari/react-hooks';

function ExampleCheckoutConfirmation({ productId }) {
  const purchasedProducts = useAsync(fetchPurchasedProducts(cartId));
  const pipeline = new Pipeline(
    {
      account: '1594153711901724220',
      collection: 'bestbuy',
    },
    'query',
    // Ensure field passed to EventTracking constructor is unique across products.
    new EventTracking('id'),
  );
  const { tracking } = useTracking();

  // send a 'purchase' event for each product.
  purchasedProducts.forEach((product) => {
    tracking.searchIOAnalytics.track('purchase', product.id);
  });

  return (
    <CartPageScaffolding>
      <PurchasedProductDetails purchasedProducts={purchasedProducts} />
    </CartPageScaffolding>
  );
}
```
