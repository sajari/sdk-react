# Tracking

Tracking in Search.io can give you insights into the search behavior of your users and how your content is performing. Tracking data is also fed back into Search.io's AI model to improve search ranking over time.

`EventTracking` records user interactions alongside search results and is designed to be as simple as possible while also being capable of handling complex/flexible use-cases - an ecommerce purchase funnel for example.

For now, Search.io's website search uses [`ClickTracking`](/tracking/clicktracking) by default while our Shopify search solution uses [`PosNegTracking`](/tracking/posnegtracking) by default. Both will transition to using `EventTracking` in the near future.

## Usage

The default when you create a new `Pipeline` instance is no tracking.

When using `EventTracking` the `field` value you specify must be the name of a field in [your schema](https://app.search.io/collection/schema) with the _Unique_ constraint.

```js
import { EventTracking, Pipeline } from '@sajari/react-hooks';

const commonConfig = {
  account: '1594153711901724220',
  collection: 'bestbuy',
};

const pipelineWithNoTracking = new Pipeline(commonConfig, 'query');
const field = 'id'; // replace 'id' with the name of a field that uniquely identifies the item in your schema
const eventTracking = new EventTracking(field);
const pipelineWithEventTracking = new Pipeline(commonConfig, 'query', eventTracking);
```

After having received the search result, clicks on an entry will record a `click` event against that query. Subsequent events tracked for the entry that was clicked will continue to be recorded against that query to improve search ranking.

Data using `EventTracking` is persisted in localStorage and sent to Search.io automatically.

```js
// In the view item screen
import { useTracking } from '@sajari/react-hooks';

const { tracking } = useTracking();
tracking.searchIOAnalytics.track('add_to_cart', item.id, { discount: 0.5 });
```
