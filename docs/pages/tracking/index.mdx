# Tracking

Analytics in Sajari can give you insights into the search behavior of your users and how your content is performing.

## 1. Getting Started

Tracking in Sajari can be one of the following:

- `ClickTracking`: records user click interactions alongside search results
- `PosNegTracking`: refers to the recording of variably weighted user interactions with search results. This allows to record both positive and negative interactions on each search result and thus is more complex/flexible than `ClickTracking`

The default when you create a new `Pipeline` instance is no tracking.

## 2. Usage

```js
import { ClickTracking, PosNegTracking, Pipeline } from '@sajari/react-hooks';

const commonConfig = {
  account: '1594153711901724220',
  collection: 'bestbuy',
};

const pipelineWithNoTracking = new Pipeline(commonConfig, 'query');
const pipelineWithClickTracking = new Pipeline(commonConfig, 'query', new ClickTracking());
const pipelineWithPosNegTracking = new Pipeline(commonConfig, 'query', new PosNegTracking('rating'));
```

Later after having received the search result, each entry will include a `token` field of that tracking type, you can then use that token to record the interactions.

## 3. Example

- [`ClickTracking`](/tracking/clicktracking)
- [`PosNegTracking`](/tracking/posnegtracking)
