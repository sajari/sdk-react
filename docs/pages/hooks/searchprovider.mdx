# SearchProvider

The `SearchProvider` should be used as a wrapper for the entire application to provide a way to share application state between hooks, for example, the current query, active filters or the search response.

```js
import { SearchProvider } from '@sajari/react-hooks';
```

## Usage

It must wrap any components where you are using hooks, usually this is done in an `App` or `index` file. You must also specify the pipeline you wish to query.

```jsx live=false
<SearchProvider
  search={{
    pipeline: new Pipeline(
      {
        account: '<Your account ID>',
        collection: '<Your collection ID>',
      },
      '<Your pipeline name>',
    ),
  }}
>
  <YourApp />
</SearchProvider>
```

- Replace the placeholders with your account and collection IDs from [the collection crendentials section](https://www.sajari.com/console/collection/credentials) in the console.
- Replace the pipeline name placeholder with the pipeline you'd like to use to query.

## Note

It is recommended that you only need to use `SearchProvider` once at the root of your application, if you find the need to use multiple collections then having multiple `SearchProvider`s would be okay too. You shouldn't nest `SearchProvider`s because each provider will create a separate new context which makes components beneath it (`Pagination`, `Sorting`) not behaving as they should.
