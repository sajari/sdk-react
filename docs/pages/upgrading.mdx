# Upgrading

The previous version of the React SDK ([`@sajari/sdk-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sajari/sdk-react])) was a single package. The latest version is split into three packages.

If you still want to use the pre-built components, you'll want to use the [`@sajari/search-ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sajari/search-ui]) package, which has the following differences from v2 of the React SDK:

- `Provider` is now [`SearchProvider`](/search-ui/searchprovider) and has new props.
- `Paginator` is now [`Pagination`](/search-ui/pagination) and has new props.
- `Values` is now [`Variables`](/classes/variables).
- `Filter` is now [`FilterBuilder`](/classes/filterbuilder) due to a naming clash with the [`Filter`](/search-ui/filter) component.
- `Response` component has been removed. If you want to hide all child components, you can access the current response via the `useSearchContext` hook.
- Render props have been removed in favour of hooks.
- Specifying the type of tracking in the pipeline constructor is no longer required. The default is `NoTracking`.
- There are also styling changes which change the visual appearance of the components.
