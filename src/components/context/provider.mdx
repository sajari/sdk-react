# Provider
`<Provider />` is the component that maintains the state of the search,
does the queries, and provides the response to the other components so
that they can update themselves when needed.

## Usage

```javascript
import { Provider, Pipeline, Values, ClickTracking } from "@sajari/sdk-react";

const pipeline = new Pipeline(
  {
    project: "<your-project>",
    collection: "<your-collection>"
  },
  "website",
  new ClickTracking()
);

const values = new Values();


ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider search={{pipeline, values}}>
    {/* Your application code here */}
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```

## Props
<PropsTable of={Provider} />
