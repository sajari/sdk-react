# Response

The `<Response />` component doesn't render its children if the pipeline `Response`
is empty (i.e. the initial pre-search state, or after `pipeline.clearResponse()` has been called).

```javascript
import { Response } from "@sajari/sdk-react"
```

## Usage

<Playground>
    <Response>
        <h1>I'll only be rendered if there is a valid response available</h1>
    </Response>
</Playground>
