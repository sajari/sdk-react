# Styling

Under the hood we use [emotion](https://emotion.sh/) for all our styling, and provide a `styles` prop on most components
to override the default styling. It is also possible to override the default styling through `css`.

## `css`

Each component that has styling attached to it, also has a series of classes attached to them as well
to allow you to override the default styling via `css`.

For an overview of what classes are on each component please refer to the individual component documentation.

### Components with `css` classes

- [Input](/components/input#styles)
- [Results](/components/results#styles)
- [Tabs](/components/tabs#styles)
- [Summary](/components/summary#styles)
- [Paginator](/components/paginator#styles)

## `styles` prop

The `styles` prop on a component takes an object that mirrors the underlaying component structure.

For example the `<Results />` component `styles` prop takes an object that matches the following shape.

```typescript
type ResultsStyles = {
  container?: CSSObject;
  item?: CSSObject;
  result?: {
    container?: CSSObject;
    title?: CSSObject;
    description?: CSSObject;
    url?: CSSObject;
  };
};
```
